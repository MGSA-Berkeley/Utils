# MGSA Code
This Github repo contains the code for the MGSA office draw and MGSA elections.
## How do I run the office draw?
Congratulations budding office czar! The first step is to add a new entry to [data.json](officedraw/data/data.json). You can copy the most recent entry, but you should update "year", "people", and "start" (the unix time of the start of the office draw in milliseconds). The "people.json" file will be automatically created by the java program, so it's ok that it doesn't exist yet. Now run the java program and start filling in the first six columns with names of graduate students, the year they will be entering, their individual priority (base priority minus priority adjustement), their priority adjustment, their blocking group, and their office if they are squatting. If this seems tedious, you can also directly copy these six columns from a spreadsheet into the corresponding "year.officedraw" file, but make sure to leave an extra blank row at the end followed by a trailing newline. Returning to the java program, the seventh column will alert you to any issues with the data. Once you have finished cleaning up the data, press CTRL-S to save the data. This will automatically generate the "people.json" file for the website. Finally, upload the changed data files to the website!
### Help! The department redesignated which offices are graduate student offices!
No worries. Simply point the "activeoffices" entry in [data.json](officedraw/data/data.json) to a modified list of active offices. If any of these offices are not yet present in [evans.json](officedraw/data/evans.json), then you will need to add new entries. But please do not delete old entries as that will break previous years.
### Help! The we're moving out of Evans!
My condolences. You'll need to point the "floorplan" entry in [data.json](officedraw/data/data.json) to a remake of [evans.json](officedraw/data/evans.json). You will also need to make new floor plan images. Please do this carefully with attention to detail since these floor plan images will be used long after you're gone. Our current floor plan images are courtesy of Larsen Linov and are perhaps the most accurate maps of Evans Hall that you can find publically.
## How do I run the election?
Congratulations budding election czar! Right now, running the election requires cloning this repo and modifying hardcoded directory paths in the code, but we're hoping to change that soon :)
